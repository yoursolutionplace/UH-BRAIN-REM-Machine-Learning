This project applies a deep learning approach to segment cell nuclei in grayscale microscopy images using the 
nnU-Net framework. By integrating biomedical imaging, microscopy, and high-performance computing, we present 
a modular and efficient segmentation pipeline. Python scripts were used throughout for data preparation, model 
configuration, and inference. Annotation was conducted in 3D Slicer. The workflow included image cropping, 3D 
volume construction, segmentation, and model training /validation. Final predictions demonstrate strong potential 
for further biological analysis, visualization, and integration into computer graphics or research workflows. Cell Nuclei Segmentation Using nnU-Net Deep Learning Model
